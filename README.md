# ASM6502
Early version of my 6502 assembler implementation. Hopefully ANSI C conformant. Confirmed to compile with clang, gcc, Pelles C without warnings. WORK IN PROGRESS! Likely contains serve bugs. Documentation missing!

## Description
It is a two pass assembler: All instruction and data sizes are determined by the first pass. The code is generated by the second pass. All addressing modes and officially documented instructions of the original 6502 are supported.

...

## Example
	CLRSCR = $E544
	CHROUT = $FFD2

	.org $801

	; BASIC code: 1024 SYS 2062
	.byte $0C,$08,$40,$00,$9E,$20,$32,$30,$36,$32,$00,$00,$00 

	  jsr CLRSCR
	  ldx #$00
 
	write:
	  lda hello,x
	  jsr CHROUT
	  inx
	  cpx #$05
	  bne write
	  rts

	hello:
	  .byte 72,69,76,76,79
